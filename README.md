# BELLY-BUTTON-ANALYSIS
I will create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that inhabit human navels.

The dataset shows that a small number of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were found in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were much less common.

# Credits
In this analysis i used my school resources like xpert learning and my professor.
